# Importance of Static Timing Analysis in Digital Circuit Design : A Systematic Review

## Overview :
This study documents my undertsandings and learnings of the concepts of Static Timing Analysis in VLSI Design. In this repositry I try to encapsulate my discoveries in the vivid landscape of STA. While making this study my curiosity towards STA turned into affinity and I intend to grow my knowledge bank even further. Additionally, I intend to extend the systematic analysis into a thorough analysis by using the concepts on an industry-standard tool; I have access to Prime Time tool via my University so I'd update this repo. as I do my timing analysis on the tool.

## Index :
The systematic review is divided into the following heirarchical index in this repositry :

1. [Introduction](Introduction.md)
2.
