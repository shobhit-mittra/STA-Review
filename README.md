# Importance of Static Timing Analysis in Digital Circuit Design : A Systematic Review

## Overview :
This study documents my undertsandings and learnings of the concepts of Static Timing Analysis in VLSI Design. In this repositry I try to encapsulate my discoveries in the vivid landscape of STA. While undergoing this study my curiosity towards STA turned into affinity and I intend to grow my knowledge bank even further. Additionally, I intend to extend the systematic analysis into a thorough analysis by using the concepts on an industry-standard tool; I have access to Prime Time tool via my University so I'd update this repo. as I do the timing analysis on the tool.

## Index :
The systematic review is divided into the following heirarchical index in this repositry :

1. [Introduction](Introduction.md) : Brief introduction to the need for STA
2. [Background : STA and its role in design flow](Background.md) : Description about the role of STA in the VLSI-design flow
3. [STA Analogy](STA_Analogy.md) : An interesting analogy of STA
4. [An Introduction to STA Essentials](STA_Essentials.md) : Concise concepts of essential to STA 
5. [Understanding Setup and Hold Time in Digital Design](Setup_Hold_Time.md) : Grasping the concept of setup and hold time in STA
6. [STA using PrimeTime](STA_PT.md) : < Currently in the Process of Understanding the PrimeTime tool >
